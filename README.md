# learn-and-work
Some codes that I learned from online courses and for my work will be stored in this repository (deep learning in protein engineering).
I would also like to list some literatures that I read about (in silico) protein engineering and AI

# (in silico) protein engineering:
- [MutateX: an automated pipeline for in-silico saturation mutagenesis of protein structures
and structural ensembles](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/824938v1.full)
- [A Computational Library Design Protocol for Rapid Improvement of Protein Stability: FRESCO](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29086304/)
